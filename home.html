<h1>About Me</h1>		         							      
<p>My name is Erica Joseph, and I'm a Computer Engineering graduate from the University of Central Florida (May 2025,  BS.)</p>
<p>I began my journey at UCF in Fall 2019, originally in Photonics. But after exploring Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, I found my passion in Computer Engineering. Early coursework in C programming taught me foundational concepts in software architecture, dynamic data handling, and good coding practices - skills that naturally led me into embedded systems. Programming microcontrollers like the MSP-EXP430G2ET and exploring complex systems deepened my interest in low-level computing.</p>
<p>Courses like Digital Systems and Computer Architecture expanded my understanding of logic design and the layers of abstraction beneath modern computing. Learning Verilog, exploring MIPS architecture, and analyzing memory management all helped demystify the "black box" of computers. Toward the end of my program, I took courses in AI and Machine Learning, including Algorithms for ML, where I studied CNNs and the math behind modern AI models.</p>
<p>Outside the classroom, I had the opportunity to intern at Siemens Energy as part of a multidisciplinary team spanning Data Science and Electrical Engineering. There, I worked on high-impact projects like modernizing legacy systems written in Visual Basic - skills I had fortunately gained in college. I also contributed to a data sourcing initiative using ethical web scraping and database comparison to support internal analytics.</p>
<p>This internship sharpened both my technical and interpersonal skills. I learned the value of communication, collaboration, and trust in professional settings - lessons I carry with me as I look ahead.</p>
<p>I'm now eager to launch my career with a company that values integrity and innovation. I'm especially passionate about Embedded Systems, Computer Architecture, and Software Development, and I look forward to bringing my experience and enthusiasm to the next chapter.</p>
<p>Thank you for your time,</p>
<p>Erica Joseph</p>
